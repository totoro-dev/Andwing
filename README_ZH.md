# SwingPro
## What is SwingPro
As a desktop UI framework, SwingPro uses Java and XML to implement desktop applications on PC. 
The view bottom layer uses swing of Java itself, which can be loaded into view through XML through encapsulation and beautification. 
To a certain extent, the process of desktop application development of swing Pro is benchmarked with the development method of Android application, 
so Android developers will easily start to use the UI framework of SwingPro.

## Why use SwingPro
SwingPro abandons the native swing development mode of Java, and provides the ability to realize the layout and management of application interface more easily.
 All application interfaces can be written with XML code, and there are corresponding management methods for windows, dialog boxes and other large components. 
 In addition to the rich controls provided by the framework, developers can further expand the original view.
